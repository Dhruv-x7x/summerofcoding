Things I have learned till now:
1. HTML and CSS Basics from freeCodeCamp
2. I have finished 4 out of 5 projects for the html&css certification
3. I'm finished with the introductory video for Docker, installed and played around with the commands as well
4. I've revised python by following youtube walkthroughs and done 3 small programs to test myself
5. I've started to learn git from youtube and set it up on my device
